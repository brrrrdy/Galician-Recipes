            <p>Padrón peppers are customarily fried in olive oil until the skin starts to blister and the pepper collapses.</p>
            <p>In and around the town of Padrón, the stems are removed before frying. Removing the stems is recommended by major Galician pepper producers and the head of the Galician tourism association on the grounds that they cause bitterness in fried peppers. Elsewhere, the stems are generally left on the peppers, and the stems are used to hold the peppers while eating.</p>
